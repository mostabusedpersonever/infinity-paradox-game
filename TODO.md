# TODO

To implement this game in the real world. Here's a todo list.

- Start small scale
- Get a garden
- Analyze neuronal networks etc.
- Learn about all the science
- Get a pet and teach it
- Then start on some game AI I guess
- Set up some sort of mini controlled environment with cameras, listening devices etc.
