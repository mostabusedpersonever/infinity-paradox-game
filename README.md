# Infinity Paradox Game

This game is an idea I have had for such a long time now.

It is about how you would embed a game into society. So basically you would play Age of Empires with this planet from outside and inside and among each other.

In this repository are my ideas and then step by step the implementations.

## The game designers / coders

Who would build this? I would say a highly intelligent layer of society. If I were smart and even a genius (which I am not, obviously) then I would hide my knowledge and only include other very smart people and force the non-smart ones into compliance. If I were smart, perhaps I would have found a way to unlock genius in everyone at will.

## Communication/Control

Hide IoT devices, cameras and listening devices into everything: lamps, attach devices to lamp posts everywhere, hide them in bird houses or on the ground.

This will allow us to control the environment manually and also automatically by some central Game AI.

## Biohacking

The participants can be humans and/or animals. They can be controlled via Biohacking (directly) or Telepathy (at large distances) or automatically (via Game AI) or willingly (Actors).

The Biohacking could consist of:
- Energy field control, to move the entities around
- Hack their fingers to brainwash them and install software, i.e. when they write something "still", they are forced to write "sit"
- Attack their minds to brainwash them and scare them
- Attack their dreams to make them think something and influence their behavior

## Scripts / Riddles

Of course no game is complete without riddles and scripts! There could be sort of mini quests everywhere: You have to ask certain people and clear the area to get further along. There could also be riddles everywhere: math riddles, logic riddles, language riddles.

## Points system

Of course at the end of the day you get points and get rewarded / punished accordingly. You might also have a color system, ranking. Some ideas:
- Bronze
- Silver
- Gold
- Platinum
- Diamond

## High level control language

Perhaps some sort of global high level language to influence the Game AI and the game. Not the comm network, that's something else. Sort of an admin language.

## Data language

Perhaps some separate language to transfer data

## IT specifics

Design malware / rootkits, benign one of course, always! ask the user to install it.

The malware:
- Manipulates your battery to show you certain numbers
- Manipulates your time
- Intercepts emails and only lets those through that make sense in a game specific context
- Manipulates your laptop, especially the fan, to tell you when you misbehave
- It is faster when you solve more and "earn" more, everything gets green, obviously

## Postal system

No game would be complete without also including the postal system delivering packages to you and letters:
- Intercept them
- Rewrite them
- Throw them away at will

## Vision

To make it more fun, devise some sort of neural eye implant that is like VR for the participants. There is a new overlay, you see reality differently:
- You can see where or how someone is injured (via nanotech or the like)
- You see their age
- Their medical records
- Their bank account
- Their name

## In person communication / behavior

Participants can communicate with each other by giving signals:
- Color coded: black person or car or the like walking by: you did something wrong and will be punished. Green: all good. Red: warning? Yellow: warning too? White: you won, I give up?
- Signals: signal with your foot, with your hand, with your head (in general)
- Signals for punishment: touch or signal the area where you want someone to get punished (e.g. left ear). If you get punished, then have someone waiting walk past with that ailment.

## Written language (game)

There should also be a written pseudo secret language that evades detection:
- Simply reuse the existing knowledge but redefine concepts
- Redefine math precedence
- Treat english as german etc.
- Upside down
- Mirrored
- Nei nei = ja

All of this can be used for plausible deniability and gas lighting. If someone confront someone, just lie.

## Written language (research/science)

Of course to implement this you have to have knowledge nobody else has, so you have power. So this must be created and designed by highly intelligent people.

This secret language will be used in secret language but the research papers will be published. Of course this game would possess next gen medicine and knowledge about mankind in general.
Spiritual knowledge too (e.g. that telepathy exists and works over many thousand kms). Never tell this to the NPCs though.

## General tactics

Lying and gas lighting, everywhere. There is no law. Only the game. You can get what you want, as long as there is "no proof". If you want something, just yell it out loud.

## NPCs

Of course to have fun you need stupid bots (humans, animals) to do what you want. So you need to brainwash them into doing their bidding:
- Use NLP techniques
- Abuse them daily and nightly, nonstop
- Treat them like an idiot
- Treat them like a dog
- Isolate them
- Refuse to acknowledge them
- Ruin their lives

## Knowledge in general

Basically just combine all of human knowledge and use it:
- Art
- Music
- Information Theory
- Math

Use the "universe as background noise".

## Apartments

To secretly steal and replace medicine and things and make the NPCs turn insane and punish / reward them. Break into their apartments. But instead of having to clone keys, just install secret entrances everywhere:
- E.g. in the bathroom
- E.g. right next to the bed
Which would lead to:
- Those who use the main door are identified as being "stupid" and NPCs or they do it on purpose as signals

## Personas themselves

- Let participants have fake IDs, fake educational records, they never have to work (it's all in good fun, right)
- Let them dress up as anything they want (law enforcement, delivering letters, gardeners...)

## The Game AI itself

- Prediction based
- Computer Vision based (to interpret signals and receive, send signals back and forth) -> Hand signals, coughing, smoke, etc.
- For this to work I would build sort of an overlay over the Internet to basically intercept and control all IT input/output at a low level and bypass encryption entirely
- Optical Flow etc.
- Kalman filters

## The environment

The environment should be highly reactive:
- Cars should wait/start based on your behavior
- Busses / trains / planes wait or not, treat you kindly or not, based on your behavior

## Your life

The game assigns you an ID and life at birth. You get made up illnesses. You get assigned "women" of a certain "attractiveness" scale based on your behavior and skills etc.

## Random unassorted

Also shoot some satellites into space to control the entirety of earth, obviously. To control GPS and the like.

Also use telepathy, so it can't be recorded by normal IT devices.

Have brain scanners everywhere.

Have the eyes scan and transmit your info everywhere instantly.

You can get reported to law enforcement for arbitrary reasons.

You can get fired from your job for arbitrary reasons. It's all in good fun.

## Teams

Then let people have teams. Make teams pages. Have them wear t-shirts

## Tapping

Have some sort of energy based tapping healing language to easily control chakras and medians.

## Compliance

For NPCs to not know they are NPCs, have participants and non participants be forced into compliance or well, you don't even need to do that. People are evil anyway.
Do not allow them outside communication etc.

## Async

In person communication can be async:
- Someone misbehaves
- Black person walks past
- Someone records that
- Gives the signal to the AI for punishment
- Punisher walks by and punishes you

## Punishments

Health related:
- Walk past with vape to give you blurry vision
- Make your nose runny
Finance related:
- Block payments
- Send random made up invoices to ruin you financially
Societal related:
- Force the other gender to ignore you, abuse you
- Force others to ignore you completely

## Computer Vision / Camera ideas

- There could be filters on the cameras, which are hacked, to filter out the game signals so that they are not detectable by outsiders
- Many filters. They could even be activatable and deactivatable

## Team structure

Teams could consist of the following roles:
- Punishers
- Healers
- Signalers (color coded, dress etc.)
- Relays (for info etc.)
- Clones, imitators
- Behavior influencers, abusers (NLP, etc.) to soften your brain
- Coughers to signal beginning/end of acts
- Actors (just people having some fun)
- Directors (controlling high level scenarios)
- Reporters (to report to the police, to others within the game, to have you recorded, arrested, jailed)

## Zones / territories

Split up the game into zones that are demarcated via CV or the like, put special markers there. If you enter or leave a zone, certain behaviors are auto triggered by the Game AI, actors or others.

## Indirect brainwashing

To resolve the participants of all responsibility, let them abuse the NPCs with an indirect language. Why have empathy, right? It's only humans and animals we are talking about. Why treat their illnesses and let them live a happy life, right? Who cares. The language:
- First assign a different identity to you
- Then talk to that person and tell him what to do. Basically re-enact what you should do
- Then you should follow
- If you don't: you are punished

Example: You have a team at a company, you use JIRA. Someone hovers over your name then someone elses, thereby assigning you a new ID. Then that person talks to the new ID guy and tells you what to do.

Direct approaches:
- Brainwash them via hypnosis (mouse movements, pen clicking sounds, stomping, ...)
- Images (e.g. show them a pic of a beach island, to tell them to go there)
- Then look at them like you are mentally deranged so that they get the hint that you are, in fact, a heartless, mentally deranged, animal
- Sound etc. too

Three steps: Compliment them, soften them. Do your bidding. Then insult them, belittle them.

This is how you get what you want from the NPCs basically. So if you were let's say, a woman, and you want an NPC man with children, you could go on Bumble and then start brainwashing your new husband into doing what you want. If you do it as a collective (the women) you might expect the men to get desperate and to follow more.

## Phone

I would link the phone to its owner and control the owner indirectly via nanotech in the owner.

The controllers / biohackers could have special software to biohack and control others on the field, right next to them. Obviously either specially encoded or there is an overlay (since everyone has a neural eye implant) so that bystanders do not or can not see what you are actually doing. Freely move them around, control their behavior, what they say and or do.

The phones will have specially modified hardware so that it is not detectable and fixable by Antivirus and other software.
